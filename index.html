                    <p>Nowadays the complexity of computing systems is skyrocketing. Programmers have to deal with extremely powerful computing systems that take time and considerable skills to be instructed to perform at their best. 
                    It is clear that <strong>it is not feasible to rely on human intervention to tune a system</strong>: conditions change frequently, rapidly, and unpredictably. 
                    It would be desirable to <strong>have the system automatically adapt to the mutating environment.</strong> </p>

                    <p>This course analyzes the stated problem, embraces a radically new approach, and it introduces <strong>how software and hardware systems ca ben adjusted during execution. </strong>
                    By doing this, we are going to introduce the <strong>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)</strong> technologies and how they can be (re)configured. </p>

                    <p>After this course you will be able to: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>explain the rationale behind an FPGA-based reconfigurable computing system;</li>
                        <li>know the importance of FPGAs and of the reconfigurable computing technologies;</li>
                        <li>compare domains to understand if they can benefit from a “reconfigurable approach”;</li>
                        <li>describe the main components used to “define” an FPGA and how a system can be implemented on it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once a student completes this course, he will be ready to take more advanced FPGA courses.</p>

                        This course is for anyone passionate about learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!
                    </p>

                        On one hand, reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation
                        but paying this in terms of time to implement.
                        On the other hand, a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the
                        same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance.
                        Within this context, the <strong>Xilinx SDx tools</strong>, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment,
                        and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements
                        of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element,
                        and <strong>having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this course, after introducing you to the FPGAs, we are going to dig more into the <strong>details on
                        how to use Xilinx SDAccel</strong> providing you also with working examples on how to optimize
                        the hardware logic to obtain the best of your hardware implementations.

                        The more general purpose you are, the more flexible you are and the more kinds of programs and algorithms you can execute on your underlying computing infrastructure. All of this is terrific, but there is no free food and this is happening, quite often, by losing efficiency.

                        This course will present several scenarios where the <strong>workloads require more performance than can be obtained even by using the fastest CPUs</strong>.
                        This scenario is turning cloud and data center architectures toward accelerated computing.
                        Within this course, we are going to show you how to <strong>gain benefits by using Xilinx SDAccel to program Amazon EC2 F1 instances</strong>. We are going to do this through a working example of an algorithm used in computational biology.
